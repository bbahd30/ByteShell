# ByteShell

### Shell Built-ins

- Commands that are built into the shell itself rather than being an external program or utility.
- They have direct access to the internal features and data structures of the shell. This allows them to manipulate shell variables, control flow, and perform other operations that are specific to the shell environment.

## Implemented Shell Built-ins

### `kill` command

- This is used to terminate processes manually.
- It sends a signal to a process that terminates the process.
- This has been implemented by using the `kill()` system call.
    
    <aside>
    ðŸ“Œ TheÂ **kill**() system call can send any signal to any process group or process.
    
    </aside>
    
    - `kill(pid, SIGTERM)` â‡’ signals it to terminate the process with specified process ID.

### `jobs` command

- `jobs` command isÂ **used to list the jobs that you are running in the background and in the foreground**.
- This is handled by creating a `struct` as shown.
    
    ```cpp
    struct Job
    {
        Job(int id, pid_t pid, string command, string status = "running")
        {
            this->id = id;
            this->pid = pid;
            this->command = command;
            this->status = status;
        }
        pid_t pid;
        int id;
        string command;
        string status;
    };
    
    vector<Job> jobs;
    ```
    

### `bg` command

- Known as the â€˜**background**â€™ command
- The function of this command is to send a service, which is working in the foreground or a stopped process, to the background using job control.
- This is done with the help of the shell and the operating system.
    
    
    | Option | Effect |
    | --- | --- |
    | %n | Sends the job, having Job ID â€˜nâ€™, to the background. |
    | %% or %+ | Sends the current job to the background. |
    | %- | Sends the previous job to the background. |
    | %string | Sends the job whose name starts withÂ stringÂ to the background. |
- Ways to start process
    - Foreground Processes
        - every process that starts run in the foreground
        - no other commands can be run (start any other processes) because the prompt will not be available until the program finishes processing and comes out.
    - Background Processes
        - also allow running other commands and waits if it needs input from the user.
        - the symbol `&` at the end of command signals the command to run as a background process
            - in case, if the process is suspended by the user (using Ctrl + Z), which is visible when used `ps` or `jobs`, the `bg` command can be used alternatively
            - `bg` moves a suspended or stopped job to the background, allowing it to continue executing while the shell can accept new commands.
        
        <aside>
        ðŸ“Œ System calls are used to wait for state changes in a child of the calling process, and obtain information about the child whose state has changed. A state change is considered to be: the child terminated; the child was stopped by a signal; or the child was resumed by a signal.
        
        </aside>
        
        - The background process creation is handled which is indicated by `&` by passing the signal `SIGCHLD`, which is signalled using `signal` function
            
            > TheÂ **signal**() system call installs a new signal handler for the signal with numberÂ *signum*.
            > 
        - This is managed using:
            
            ```cpp
            if (!backgroundProcess)
            {
            		int status;
                waitpid(pid, &status, 0);
            }
            else
            {
            		signal(SIGCHLD, handleSignal);
                cout << "Background process created with PID: " << pid << endl;
            }
            ```
            
- When a foreground process is stopped using the `Ctrl+Z`, the process is with status of â€˜stoppedâ€™ is instantiated and pushed to `jobs` vector
    - the stopped process is resumed and run in background by using the `bg` command, which is implemented by using the `kill(pid, SIGCONT)` system call, which tells that process to restart.
